# Test Results for Support Ticket Management System

## Original User Problem Statement
L'utilisateur a demandé une interface de gestion de tickets de support avec interface bleu pastel thème sombre (style React Admin). Les fonctionnalités principales incluent les opérations CRUD pour clients, demandeurs et agents, une page de supervision des tickets, et un système de commentaires/échanges. Recent additions include agents creating tickets (requiring client and requestor selection), a ticket refresh button, ticket status/client filtering for agents, and a comment system within tickets.

## Current Issue Being Addressed
Finalizing the ticket comment/exchange functionality that's experiencing a 500 error with the `/api/ticket-echanges` API endpoint. The user also requested visual improvements for long comment threads with proper scrolling capabilities.

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Test all API endpoints systematically

- Validate error handling and responses
- Test edge cases and input validation

### Frontend Testing Guidelines  
- Test user interface interactions
- Verify data display and form submissions
- Check responsive design and accessibility
- Test authentication flows
- Validate error messages and loading states

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always implement specific user requirements exactly as requested
- Prioritize functionality over perfection
- Focus on MVP-level solutions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
