The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive support ticket management application, demonstrating strong adaptability to evolving user requirements and technical challenges. Initially, the focus was on setting up the core application with React, Netlify Functions, and Neon DB, correcting early architectural mistakes (FastAPI to Netlify Functions, module types). The trajectory showcases a continuous refinement cycle, moving from basic CRUD to advanced UI/UX features like a modern messenger-style comment system with dynamic alignment, emoji support, and real-time updates. The engineer meticulously addressed reported bugs, including database constraint violations and UI synchronization issues, consistently using screenshot validations to confirm functionality. The work culminated in a robust and user-friendly system, ready for continued development.

The user initially requested a support ticket management interface with a pastel blue, dark-themed UI (React Admin style). Core functionalities included CRUD for , , and . A ticket supervision page with title, status, and dates, and an edit page for tickets (title, linked client, status, dates, file upload, initial request, text exchanges) were essential. Clients should see linked tickets, requestors view company tickets. The tech stack required React JS, Netlify deployment, and Neon (PostgreSQL) via  and Netlify Functions, with email/password authentication for agents (admin@voipservices.fr, admin1234!) and requestors.

Subsequent additions and refinements included:
- Agents creating tickets with client and requestor selection.
- A ticket refresh button.
- Ticket status and client filtering for agents.
- A comprehensive comment system within tickets.
- Visual adaptation for long comment blocks with scrolling.
- Messenger-like comment discussion (blocks left/right based on user role, then dynamically based on logged-in user).
- Auto-scroll to the latest message in comments.
- An emoji selection bar for comments.
- Automatic status change to répondu when an agent adds a comment.
- Agent's ability to change ticket status directly in the detail view.
- Removal of automatic comment refresh.
- Automatic comment upon file upload (A ajouté une pièce jointe...).
- Répondu status added to ticket filters in the supervision menu.
- Status and client filters made available to requestors.
- Automatic status change to en cours when an agent opens a Nouveau ticket.
- Loader animation on the comment send button.
- Loader animation on the ticket list refresh button.
- Correct display of updated status in the ticket detail modal.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React JS**: Frontend for dynamic UI.
- **Netlify Functions**: Serverless JavaScript backend.
- **Neon Database (@netlify/neon)**: PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for theming.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API interaction.
- **CommonJS**: Module system for Netlify Functions.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Main React component, handling routing and overall application structure. No explicit changes were detailed in the trajectory, but it orchestrates the UI.
- ****: Manages authentication state and provides an Axios  instance with JWT. This file was modified to expose  or  information necessary for dynamically aligning messages (my messages right, others left).
- ****: This is the most heavily modified file, implementing the core ticket management UI.
    -   **Summary**: Handles ticket display, creation, editing, filtering, and the complex comment section.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for comment UI (scroll, adaptive height, modern design, avatars, character counter), messenger-style layout (left/right alignment), emoji integration, auto-scroll to new comments, manual refresh button for comments, agent-specific inline status change, auto-status update logic (to répondu on agent comment, to en cours on view), file upload interface, and loaders for send/refresh actions. Logic for  was refined to ensure  state updates correctly.
- ****: A Netlify Function for handling ticket comments (fetching and posting).
    -   **Summary**: Serves as the backend API for comment interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Initial fix to accept ticket IDs as query parameters instead of path parameters, confirming its functionality after a false 500 error report.
- ****: A newly created Netlify Function for file uploads.
    -   **Summary**: Manages the storage and retrieval of attached files for tickets.
    -   **Changes**: New file created to implement file attachment functionality.
- ****: Global and component-specific styles.
    -   **Summary**: Provides custom CSS for various UI elements.
    -   **Changes**: Added custom styles for scrollbars, message bubbles, emoji picker, and specific status badges (e.g., répondu).
- ****: Defines the Neon database schema.
    -   **Summary**: Crucial for setting up tables like  and .
    -   **Changes**: Corrected a duplicate  table definition. Modified the  table's  check constraint to include the new répondu status.
- ****: A new SQL script.
    -   **Summary**: Provides a migration script to update the  table's status constraint in an existing database.
    -   **Changes**: Created to address the  constraint violation, explicitly adding repondu to the allowed statuses.
- ****: Used for logging test results and communication.
    -   **Summary**: Documents testing protocols and outcomes.
    -   **Changes**: Created early in the trajectory and periodically updated with backend and frontend testing summaries, and user feedback incorporation.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the  script is executed on the Neon Database to apply the necessary  constraint update. This was explicitly mentioned as an Action requise by the AI engineer.

<current_work>
The immediate focus was on resolving two user-reported issues:
1.  **null value in column titre of relation tickets violates not-null constraint error**: This error occurred when an agent opened a ticket, triggering an automatic status change to en cours. The root cause was  not receiving complete ticket data, leading to a partial update that violated database constraints. The AI engineer fixed this by modifying  to properly accept and use the full  object, ensuring all necessary fields are present during the update.
2.  **Missing loader on the Actualiser button (ticket supervision page)**: The user requested visual feedback when the main ticket list is being refreshed. The AI engineer implemented this by introducing a  state, which is set to  when  is called with a  flag, and reset to  in a  block. The Actualiser button now dynamically displays a spinner and Actualisation... text while data is being fetched, and is disabled to prevent multiple clicks.

The very last task completed was addressing the visual synchronization issue where the status in the ticket detail modal remained Nouveau even after an automatic change to en cours. This was resolved by explicitly updating the  state using  within the  function, ensuring the UI consistently reflects the actual status. The screenshots confirm this fix.
