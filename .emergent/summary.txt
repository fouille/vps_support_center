The AI engineer successfully migrated the application from a single-page architecture to a multi-route system using , implementing dynamic URLs for various sections like tickets, portabilities, and productions. This involved creating new components like , , and , and extensively refactoring existing ones. Throughout the process, the engineer addressed multiple critical bugs, including fixing SPA routing issues, resolving Invalid time value errors in date formatting, restoring lost UI functionalities (e.g., WhatsApp-like chat, emoji picker), correcting API call payloads for file uploads, refining UI layouts, and fixing SQL syntax errors in backend functions. Key enhancements included making chatbot items clickable, dynamically generating email links based on the demandeur's society domain, and re-implementing an Annulation button for portabilities. The final task addressed involved a persistent auto-scroll issue in ticket details, which was tackled by implementing sequential data loading and a timed scroll mechanism, along with cleaning up console logs.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack support ticket management system featuring Portabilités and Production modules, with CRUD operations, file uploads, text exchanges, and JWT security. Implemented features include a dynamic login page, password reset, various UX enhancements, demandeur society editing, a Trunk Only PDF template, and PDF attachment options. The email service was migrated to Brevo, and version control enhanced. A Recent Exchanges Chatbot displays recent interactions, and theme preference persists via local storage. Ticket statuses automatically update to en_attente when a demandeur adds comments or attachments (unless nouveau).

The application has now been enhanced with:
1.  **Dynamic Routing**: Full  implementation for dynamic URLs across , , , , and administrative pages (, , , ), including detail pages ().
2.  **Chatbot Interactivity**: Recent exchanges in the chatbot are clickable, navigating to the specific ticket or portability page. Production items remain non-clickable.
3.  **Enhanced Emails**: Automated emails now include direct, clickable links to relevant tickets and portabilities, with the base URL dynamically derived from the demandeur's society domain.
4.  **Portabilities Features**: File upload/download/delete functionality, a WhatsApp-style comment section with emoji support, and an Annulation /! button for demandeurs have been re-integrated.
5.  **Ticket Detail UX**: Auto-scroll to the latest message in ticket exchanges, WhatsApp-like comment styling, emoji picker, and Enter to send message behavior are fully functional.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent auto-scroll issue within the Ticket Detail page (). The user reported that the message exchange block was not automatically scrolling to the latest message upon opening a ticket, forcing manual scrolling. The user also requested the removal of all console logs from this page.

The AI engineer implemented the following:
1.  **Sequential Loading**: The fetching of ticket details and file attachments was separated from the fetching of exchanges. The  function now loads the primary ticket information and files first.
2.  **Exchange Loading Trigger**: A  hook was introduced to specifically trigger  only once the main  object has been successfully loaded and the  state is false. This ensures the exchanges are fetched only when the page's core content is ready.
3.  **Enhanced Auto-scroll**: The auto-scroll mechanism () is now precisely timed. It's triggered within a  with an increased delay of  after  updates the state. This delay provides sufficient time for the DOM to render the new messages before the scroll is initiated, improving reliability.
4.  **UI Feedback**: A loader mechanism () was added to the message exchange area, providing visual feedback to the user while comments are being fetched.
5.  **Console Cleanup**: All  and  statements were systematically removed from  to ensure a clean console output as requested by the user.

This approach aims to provide a smoother user experience by displaying the main ticket information quickly, then progressively loading exchanges with a clear loading indicator, and finally ensuring an accurate and reliable auto-scroll to the latest conversation.
