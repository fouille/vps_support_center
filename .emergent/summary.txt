The previous AI engineer successfully extended the support ticket application by integrating complex features and resolving critical issues. Initially, the focus was on refining client management (searchable select, pagination, dark mode), implementing auto-generated ticket numbers, and integrating Mailjet for email notifications. This laid a robust foundation. Subsequently, the engineer was tasked with developing a new Portabilités section, mirroring ticket management. This involved creating new SQL tables, Netlify functions (CRUD, comments, file uploads), and React frontend components (pages, forms, detail views). Challenges arose with frontend routing (React Router vs. state-based navigation), API authentication ( errors), and form validation/UX. The engineer systematically debugged these, often using browser console logs and screenshots, confirming fixes iteratively. The latest work focused on resolving UUID errors during portability creation and significantly enhancing the portability form's visual layout and client-side validation, ensuring a professional and functional user experience.

The core application is a support ticket management system with CRUD for clients, requestors, and agents, featuring a ticket supervision page and an edit page with file uploads and text exchanges. It supports email/password authentication. Recent enhancements include agent ticket creation, advanced filtering, a messenger-style comment system, automatic status updates, inline agent status change, automatic comment on file upload, loader animations, auto-generated 6-digit ticket numbers with search, and refined client management UX (pagination, debounced search, dark mode). Mailjet integration sends email notifications for ticket creation, comments, and status changes.

The user requested a new Portabilités section for telecom portability requests, similar to ticket management. Key requirements included:
-   Supervision of ongoing requests (Agents & Requestors).
-   Creation of new requests (Agents & Requestors) with an auto-generated 8-digit ID.
-   Comment system identical to tickets.
-   Follow, modify, delete requests (Agents), follow/comment (Requestors).
-   Dedicated SQL table for portabilities.
-   Request creation fields: auto-generated ID, requestor attribution, creation date, client (searchable select), status (Nouveau, Bloqué, Rejeté, En cours, Demandé, Validé, Terminé), requested/effective portability dates, ported numbers (textarea), address, postcode, city, client email/name/surname/Siret, Fiabilisation demandée? (yes/no), Demande signée? (yes/no), PDF upload zone.
-   Supervision table display: ID, client name, status, portability dates.
-   Filtering by status, client, or ID search.
-   Visual alert (emoji/red) for effective portability date.
-   Email notifications for new requests, comments, and status changes.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React JS**: Frontend development.
-   **Netlify Functions**: Serverless backend for API endpoints.
-   **Neon Database (@netlify/neon)**: PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication across frontend and backend.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and dark mode.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests, replaced by  context for consistent authentication.
-   **CommonJS**: Module system used in Netlify Functions.

-   **Debouncing**: Optimizing search input performance on client lists.
-   **UUID/SQL Triggers**: For auto-generating unique IDs.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and Netlify Functions backend, connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database.


-   ****: New page to list, filter, and search portability requests. Modified to use state-based navigation, display an informative error message if SQL tables aren't created, and use the authenticated  object.
-   ****: New form for creating/editing portability requests. Significant visual overhaul to categorize inputs. Modified to use the  object for requests and includes client-side validation for mandatory fields, including the  for agents.
-   ****: New page for viewing a single portability request with its comments and file uploads. Adapted to state-based navigation and uses the authenticated  object.
-   ****: The main layout component. Modified to include Portabilités in the navigation menu and adapted to use the application's original state-based navigation ( prop) instead of React Router. Also had padding restored for correct centering.
-   ****: The root React component. Reverted from React Router to the original state-based navigation system ( state and  function) to resolve authentication and navigation conflicts.
-   ****: Modified to explicitly export  alongside  and , resolving import errors in other components.
-   ****: New backend API for CRUD operations on portability requests. Fixed authentication issues by aligning JWT secret and database connection method () with existing APIs. Implemented server-side validation to convert empty  to  to prevent UUID errors.
-   ****: New backend API for managing comments related to portability requests, mirroring .
-   ****: New backend API for handling file uploads/downloads for portability requests, mirroring .
-   ****: Modified to include new email templates and sending logic for portability-related notifications (creation, comments, status changes), leveraging Mailjet.
-   ****: New SQL script to create the  and  tables, including triggers for auto-generated 8-digit portability IDs, and associated indices and test data.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on finalizing the Portabilités section, addressing critical bugs and user experience refinements.
Initially, the AI engineer developed the core Portabilités feature, including SQL scripts, Netlify functions for CRUD, comments, file uploads, and React frontend pages (, , ).

Several issues arose during integration and testing:
1.  **Frontend Build Error ( export)**: The  was not directly exported from , causing build failures. This was fixed by adding .
2.  **Navigation and Authentication Conflict**: Introduction of React Router for portability pages clashed with the existing state-based navigation and authentication system, leading to continuous redirects to the login page (). The solution involved reverting the frontend (, , portability components) to the original state-based navigation (using  state and  props).
3.  **API Authorization Error (Token invalide)**: The newly created  backend API was returning a  error because its JWT secret and database connection () were inconsistent with the existing, working APIs ( uses ). This was corrected by aligning  to use  and the correct . The API was also re-enabled after temporary testing code was removed.
4.  **UUID Input Error**: When creating a new portability, a PostgreSQL error invalid input syntax for type uuid:  occurred if the  was an empty string instead of  or a valid UUID. The  API was updated to convert an empty string  to  before database insertion.
5.  **Form UX and Missing Demandeur Field**: The portability creation form was visually unorganized. It also needed the Demandeur (requestor) selection field to be visible for agents and validated. The  was significantly refactored:
    *   The form width was increased ().
    *   Inputs were grouped into three distinct, colored, and numbered sections (Choix du client, Données du client, Informations de portabilité) for better readability.
    *   Client-side validation was added to ensure the  field is selected when an agent creates a portability.

The current state is that all frontend and backend code for the Portabilités section has been implemented and is functionally sound, with robust error handling and an improved user experience for the form. The application successfully navigates to the Portabilités page, displays a placeholder message if the database tables aren't created, and the creation form is well-structured and validates input.
