The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the support ticket application from basic CRUD to a feature-rich system. Key work involved:
1.  **Client Management Refinements**: Transformed client filtering into a searchable select, made client / optional, added a  field, and implemented pagination with debounced instant search on the Clients page. UX was improved by fixing full-page refreshes and dark mode contrast for the client table.
2.  **Ticket Numbering**: Integrated an auto-generated 6-digit ticket number, allowing search by this number in the ticket supervision page.
3.  **Mailjet Integration**: Set up email notifications for ticket creation, comments, and status changes. This involved creating an , adapting backend APIs, and resolving critical dependency ( version/API changes) and Netlify Functions deployment issues related to  and  initialization.
The engineer consistently used testing tools and screenshots to validate fixes and new features, demonstrating a robust development and debugging cycle.

<product_requirements>
The application is a support ticket management system with a dark, pastel blue UI. Core features include CRUD for clients, requestors, and agents. Key functionalities developed are: a ticket supervision page (title, status, dates), an edit page for tickets (title, client, status, dates, file upload, request, text exchanges), client/requestor specific views, and email/password authentication.

Recent enhancements include:
- Agent ticket creation with client/requestor selection.
- Ticket refresh button, status, and client filtering (now with a searchable select).
- A comprehensive, messenger-style comment system with auto-scroll and emoji support.
- Automatic ticket status updates (to répondu on agent comment, en cours on view).
- Inline agent status change.
- Automatic comment upon file upload.
- Loader animations for send/refresh actions.
- Automatic 6-digit ticket number generation and search by ticket number.
- Client management UX: pagination displaying 10 results, instant search with debounce (min 3 characters, 1-second delay, only table updates), and correct display in dark mode.
- Mailjet integration for email notifications on ticket creation (to  and requestor), comments (agent ↔ requestor), and status changes (to requestor), with styled HTML content.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and Netlify Functions acting as the backend, connected to a Neon (PostgreSQL) database.



-   ****: This file now implements the client list with advanced features. Changes include: integration of a  for client filtering, display of the new  field, making  and  optional in the UI, and implementing client search with a debounce mechanism. It also incorporates pagination and refined loading states to only refresh the table content during searches, alongside style adjustments for dark mode readability.
-   ****: The backend API for clients was updated. It now supports the  field, allows  and  to be nullable, and implements query parameters for pagination (, ) and instant search ().
-   ****: A central component for ticket management. Modifications include: integrating the  component for client filtering, displaying the newly introduced , and adjusting its logic to correctly parse API responses which now include a  wrapper for lists (due to pagination).
-   ****: This function was significantly updated to handle the new  (generated by a database trigger) and support search queries based on this number. It also integrates calls to the new  for sending emails on ticket creation and status changes. Logic for combining various filters (status, client, ticket number) was refactored.
-   ****: A newly created utility module. It centralizes all Mailjet email sending logic, including different HTML templates for ticket creation, comments, and status changes. It correctly initializes  using  and retrieves API keys from environment variables.
-   ****: A new  file was created specifically within the  directory. This is crucial for Netlify Functions to properly bundle and deploy Node.js dependencies like  and .
-   ****: A new SQL script that defines the  column in the  table and includes a trigger to automatically generate a random 6-digit number upon ticket insertion.
-   ****: A new SQL script that alters the  table to add the  column and modify the  and  columns to be nullable.

<current_work>
The immediate focus was on addressing user feedback regarding the Clients page. The user reported two main issues:
1.  **Full page refresh during search**: Previously, any character typed into the search bar or pagination change caused the entire page to re-render, leading to a jarring user experience. The AI engineer corrected this by refining the state management in . New states like  and  were introduced.  controls whether the full initial loading screen is shown, while  specifically handles the loading state of the client table during search queries or pagination, ensuring only the table itself reloads. This was achieved by modifying the  dependencies and conditional rendering.
2.  **Dark mode contrast issues**: The text within the client table (headers and cell content) appeared black on a dark background, making it unreadable. The AI engineer fixed this by updating the Tailwind CSS classes within  to ensure proper contrast for both light and dark modes. Specifically, table headers now use , cell content uses , and the table background uses .

The engineer confirmed these fixes with screenshots and detailed explanations, stating that the interface is now fluide, professionnelle et entièrement fonctionnelle en mode clair et sombre.
