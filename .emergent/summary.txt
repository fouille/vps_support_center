The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic support ticket application into a robust platform. Initially, a major Portabilités section was developed, incorporating comprehensive CRUD, comment systems, and file management, mirroring existing ticket functionalities. The engineer systematically resolved numerous technical challenges, including fixing , navigation, and critical JWT authentication inconsistencies. A significant effort was made to restructure file attachments, moving them from the main  table to a dedicated  table, requiring extensive backend and frontend adjustments.

Subsequent work focused on enhancing UX, such as step-by-step forms and modern comment styles. Key fixes addressed API data format issues,  payload discrepancies (transitioning from  to ), and implementing non-blocking form validation for new entries. A robust automatic semantic versioning system was introduced, visible via a footer and integrated into the development workflow. Most recently, the engineer implemented an INSEE API integration for SIRET-based address auto-completion in the portability form and a comprehensive token expiration handling system, including client-side checks, API interceptors, and user notifications. The overall approach was iterative, addressing user feedback directly and documenting changes with versioning.

The application serves as a comprehensive support ticket management system, facilitating CRUD operations for clients, requestors, and agents, with a supervision page for tickets, and features like file uploads and text exchanges, all secured by email/password authentication. Recent enhancements improved agent workflows (ticket creation, filtering, messenger-style comments, status updates, auto-comments on file uploads, loader animations), added auto-generated 6-digit ticket numbers, refined client management UX (pagination, debounced search, dark mode), and integrated Mailjet for notifications.

A new Portabilités section was introduced to manage telecom portability requests. This module was designed to mirror ticket functionalities, including supervision, creation, modification, and deletion for agents, and viewing/commenting for requestors. Portability requests require auto-generated 8-digit IDs and extensive fields such as client details, dates, numbers, address, and PDF uploads. The supervision table must display key portability details and support filtering, with visual alerts for effective portability dates and email notifications. Later refinements included improved Demandeur selection, step-by-step form navigation, conditional visibility for Date effective, resolution of  errors for comment APIs, conversion of portability details to a modal, and fixing empty modal data. More recent critical updates focused on enhancing comment display (date/time, modern styling), adding an Annulation button for demandeurs, fixing automatic form validation at step 3, improving modal button positioning, and crucially, correcting the file attachment storage mechanism to use a dedicated table. A semantic versioning system with a visible footer was also explicitly requested. The latest additions include INSEE API integration for SIRET-based address auto-filling and robust JWT token expiration handling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed implementing a comprehensive system to manage JWT token expiration. This directly addressed the user's issue where the site would display pages but API requests would fail silently with  after 24 hours.

The implemented solution involves:
1.  **Backend API ( in frontend):** A global API response interceptor was modified to explicitly catch both  errors and  responses that contain the  detail. Upon detection, it triggers a logout process.
2.  **Client-Side Token Validation ():** A utility function was added to decode the JWT token and verify its expiration time. This check is performed before API requests and also periodically (every 5 minutes) to proactively detect expired tokens even if the user remains idle on the site.
3.  **User Notification (, , ):** New  and  components were created. When a token is detected as expired (either via API response or client-side check), a clear Session expirée notification is displayed to the user for 3 seconds.
4.  **Automatic Redirection ():** After the notification, the user is automatically redirected to the login page to re-authenticate, ensuring a seamless user experience instead of silent failures.
5.  **Documentation and Testing Script:** A  file was created to document this new functionality, and a  script was provided to simulate token expiration for testing purposes.

This work ensures that the application robustly handles token expiration, providing clear feedback to the user and guiding them to re-authenticate. The user's last feedback (Parfait cela fonctionne.) indicates satisfaction with the implemented solution for JWT expiration, concluding this specific task.
