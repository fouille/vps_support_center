<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the application from an MVP to a more feature-rich and robust system. The work primarily involved implementing new functionalities, enhancing user experience, and iteratively debugging complex issues across the frontend (React) and backend (Netlify Functions, PostgreSQL). Key feature additions included dynamic login page customization (logo, favicon, app name), comprehensive password reset, and a Ma Société editing feature for demandeurs. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on resolving persistent infinite API call loops and refining data filtering logic, particularly in the  and  components. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging, often by adding detailed console logs, simplifying complex conditional logic, and adjusting database queries. The latest efforts have been concentrated on ensuring demandeur-specific features (like Ma Société modal pre-fill) function correctly by addressing permission issues, inconsistent API response structures, and proper data binding in the UI.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack support ticket management system with modules for Portabilités and Production, supporting CRUD, file uploads, and text exchanges, secured by JWT.
During this trajectory, the following features and improvements were implemented:
1.  **Login Page Customization**: Dynamically display company logo, favicon, and application name based on domain. This required adding , , and  fields to the  table and form, and creating an unauthenticated API to fetch these details.
2.  **Password Reset Functionality**: A Forgot password? feature on the login page using a modal, reCAPTCHA v3, a Netlify Function to verify user, generate/update password, and send email via Mailjet.
3.  **UX Enhancements**:
    *   Improved client search in ticket creation with server-side search (3+ characters debounce) and agent/demandeur role preservation.
    *   Scrollable lists () for Tickets and Productions pages.
    *   Fixed application footer (initially had issues, later corrected).
    *   Side-by-side client search fields on Clients page.
    *   Filter Hors Scope tasks in Production details.
    *   Add Outils button with G711.org link in Support page for all users.
    *   Dynamic height for ticket detail échanges section.
    *   Loader and 3-character minimum for ticket search by number.
4.  **Security Enhancement**: Removed sensitive log information from frontend console.
5.  **Refactor reCAPTCHA**: Migrated from v2 to native v3 with score threshold.
6.  **Demandeur Society Editing**: Allow demandeurs to edit their own society's email, logo, domain, favicon, and app name via a Ma Société button in Mes Collaborateurs section.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React.js frontend, Node.js (Netlify Functions) backend, and a Neon (PostgreSQL) database.



-   ****: Handles authentication, domain-based logo/favicon display, and password reset. Modified to dynamically load  and  from the backend and update the page's favicon and title dynamically.
-   ****: Manages demandeur and society data. Extended to include Favicon upload and Nom application text field in society forms. Added a Ma Société button and modal for demandeurs to edit their society's contact email, logo, domain, favicon, and app name. Implemented robust data loading for  to handle various API response structures and fallback from  to  name.
-   ****: Defines global layout and navigation. Modified to dynamically display the  in the header and page title, fetching it based on  or domain. Fixed persistence issues after login/refresh.
-   ****: Displays and manages support tickets. Implemented scrollable list, fixed client search for continuous API calls (using  and  dependencies), and added a debounced search with loader for ticket number. Added an Outils dropdown menu with a G711.org link, visible to both agents and demandeurs. Corrected dynamic height for the échanges section in ticket detail modal.
-   ****: Manages production requests. Implemented scrollable list. Modified to filter out Hors Scope tasks from the task summary view.
-   ****: Reusable component for searchable dropdowns. Fixed infinite API call loop by removing  from  dependencies and separating search logic. Modified  to trigger an empty search.
-   ****: Manages global authentication. Modified to ensure  is included in the  object when decoded from JWT.
-   ****: Backend API for managing society data. Extended GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations to handle  and . Implemented comprehensive authorization rules: agents can perform all CRUD on any society, while demandeurs can only GET and PUT (specific fields) their own associated society. Validations for favicon (ICO format, size) were added.
-   ****: Unauthenticated API to fetch society info by domain. Modified to return  and  in addition to  and .
-   ****: Backend API for managing tickets. Refactored complex conditional filtering logic for agents and demandeurs to ensure correct filtering by , , and . Corrected user type detection from JWT and removed  usage for Neon compatibility.
-   ****: Backend API for production tasks. Updated queries to manage  field, addressing trigger issues.
-   ****: Backend API for authentication. Modified to ensure  is included in the user data returned for demandeurs, retrieved from the  table.
-   ** (NEW)**: SQL script to add  (TEXT) and  (VARCHAR(100)) columns to the  table.
-   ** (NEW)**: SQL script to drop the problematic  trigger from the  table, which was causing  errors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent bug in the Ma Société modal within . The user reported that even with correct API responses showing society data, the form fields were not pre-filling, and console logs showed Sociétés extraites: [].

The root cause was identified as an inconsistency in the API response structure when using . While the  API (for demandeurs) correctly returned society data within  as an array (e.g., ), the  library wraps the actual data payload one more level deep. So, the frontend was receiving . The previous fix attempted to handle  as an array or , but the correct path was .

The AI engineer applied the following corrections:
1.  ** - **: Modified the logic to first check for  as the primary source of the societies array. It also retains fallbacks for other potential structures ( as an array or ) for robustness.
2.  ** - **: Applied the identical fix for robustly extracting society data to ensure consistent behavior during form submission.

These changes are intended to correctly parse the API response, allow the Ma Société modal to pre-fill with existing society data, and ensure that the society can be found and updated. Services were restarted after these changes.
