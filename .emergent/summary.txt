The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the application from an MVP to a more feature-rich product. This trajectory details several key development cycles. Initially, the engineer resolved UI inconsistencies, particularly padding issues on  and  pages, and refined the  deletion process to prevent full page reloads, implementing a modal close and table refresh instead. A significant feature added was a direct delete icon in the  table for agents.

A major enhancement involved introducing a dual management system for  and , requiring a new SQL table, comprehensive backend API (CRUD for companies), and extensive frontend modifications (tabbed interface, company creation with INSEE API autocomplete, logo upload, conditional fields for demanders). The engineer also ensured proper permission handling, allowing demanders to manage users within their assigned company. Bug fixes included correcting the INSEE API field mapping, removing the password field from the demander edit modal, and adjusting ticket/portability filtering to use  for demanders. Finally, the engineer addressed UI layout issues, making the footer sticky and ensuring the left-side navigation menu remained fully visible, and fixed a critical Netlify build error related to  dependency and  version. Throughout, semantic versioning was meticulously applied after each major change or bug fix.

The application is a support ticket management system, handling CRUD operations for clients, requestors, and agents, with features like file uploads and text exchanges. A Portabilités section mirrors ticket functionalities for telecom portability requests, including auto-generated IDs, extensive fields, filtering, and email notifications. Semantic versioning with a visible footer was mandated. Recent updates focused on:
1.  **UI Consistency**: Calibrate padding on Portabilités and Clients pages to match other pages.
2.  **Portability Deletion**: When deleting a portability, close the modal and refresh the table instead of a full page reload.
3.  **Quick Delete**: Add a red trash icon for agents to directly delete portabilities from the table view.
4.  **Dual Demandeur Management**:
    *   Create  table (indexed to ).
    *   Develop Netlify API (GET, DELETE, POST, PUT) for , secured by JWT.
    *   Modify Demandeurs page to switch between Demandeurs and Demandeurs Sociétés lists for agents.
    *   Enable agents to create new  with logo import, SIRET (autocomplete via INSEE API), name, address, phone, and email.
    *   When creating a , agents select the society; demanders auto-assign to their society.
    *   Demandeurs must access the Demandeurs menu to manage/create other demandeurs within their own society.
5.  **INSEE Autocomplete Fix**: Correct the mapping for SIRET API responses in the  creation modal.
6.  **Demandeur Edit**: Remove the password field from the demander edit modal to prevent accidental overwrites.
7.  **Company-wide Visibility**: For demanders, support tickets and portability requests should be displayed based on their , not  name.
8.  **UI Footer**: Ensure the footer is always visible at the bottom of the page without scrolling.
9.  **UI Sidebar**: After footer changes, fix the left navigation menu to be full height and fixed.
10. **Versioning**: Automatically run the semantic versioning script after significant updates/fixes.
11. **Build Fix**: Resolve Netlify build errors, specifically Cannot find module uri-js and  issues.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed fixing a critical Netlify build error that prevented deployments. The error Cannot find module uri-js and issues with  version 17.x.x were causing dependency installation failures.

The implemented solution involved:
1.  **Dependency Fix in  (root)**:
    *   Added  as a direct dependency with version .
    *   Downgraded  from  to  to ensure compatibility and resolve the underlying issue.
2.  **Dependency Fix in **:
    *   Also added  as a dependency here to ensure all Netlify functions have the required module.
3.  **Build Validation**: Successfully ran yarn run v1.22.22
