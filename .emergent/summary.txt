The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the support ticket application into a comprehensive platform. Key achievements include enhancing client management, implementing auto-generated ticket numbers, and integrating Mailjet. A major focus was the development of a new Portabilités section, mirroring ticket functionalities with dedicated SQL tables, Netlify functions (CRUD, comments, file uploads), and React components.

Throughout the trajectory, the engineer demonstrated systematic debugging. Initial challenges involved resolving  export issues, navigation conflicts (reverting from React Router to state-based), and API authentication (Token invalide errors due to JWT secret and database connection inconsistencies). The engineer also improved the portability form's UX with a step-by-step layout and client-side validation, and addressed UUID errors. Most recently, the work focused on resolving an empty portability details modal display by correcting data access from API responses (handling array vs. object). The current task involves refining the  API to ensure correct data return for single record lookups.

<product_requirements>
The application is a support ticket management system. Its core features include CRUD operations for clients, requestors, and agents, a ticket supervision page, and an edit page with file uploads and text exchanges. Authentication is email/password-based. Recent enhancements added agent ticket creation, advanced filtering, a messenger-style comment system, automatic status updates, inline agent status change, automatic comment on file upload, loader animations, auto-generated 6-digit ticket numbers with search, and refined client management UX (pagination, debounced search, dark mode). Mailjet integration provides email notifications for ticket creation, comments, and status changes.

The user explicitly requested a new Portabilités section for telecom portability requests, similar to the existing ticket management. Key requirements for this section include:
- Supervision, creation, modification, and deletion of portability requests (agents).
- Viewing and commenting on requests (requestors).
- Auto-generated 8-digit portability IDs.
- Dedicated SQL tables.
- Request creation fields: auto-generated ID, requestor attribution, creation date, client (searchable select), status, requested/effective portability dates, ported numbers, address, postcode, city, client contact details, Fiabilisation demandée?, Demande signée?, and PDF upload.
- Supervision table display of ID, client name, status, and portability dates.
- Filtering by status, client, or ID search.
- Visual alerts for effective portability date.
- Email notifications for new requests, comments, and status changes.

Further user requests evolved into:
- Correcting the Demandeur (requestor) selection on the portability creation form to appear for agents and pre-fill for requestors.
- Implementing a step-by-step navigation for the three sections of the portability creation form.
- Hiding the Date effective field in the portability creation form, making it editable only in agent edit mode and optional in the API/DB.
- Resolving a  error for the  API due to JWT secret inconsistency.
- Transforming the portability details view into a modal instead of a separate page.
- Fixing the issue where portability details were not displayed in the modal despite the API returning data.

The application uses a React frontend and Netlify Functions backend, connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database.


-   ****: Main page to list portabilities. Now imports and utilizes  to display details instead of navigating to a separate page.
-   ****: Form for creating/editing portabilities. Updated to manage  selection visibility and auto-prefill based on user type. Significantly refactored to implement a step-by-step UI for its sections and hides  during creation.
-   ****: Component to display single portability details. Modified to correctly check  and now rendered within .
-   ****: *New file*. Encapsulates the display logic for portability details, comments, and file uploads within a modal window. Includes logic to correctly parse API response () to populate fields.
-   ****: Main layout component. Modified to integrate Portabilités into navigation and adapted for state-based navigation.
-   ****: Root React component. Reverted to state-based navigation to resolve routing and authentication conflicts.
-   ****: Exports  directly, resolving import issues.
-   ****: Backend API for portabilities. Fixed authentication (JWT secret consistency,  usage) and handles  empty string to  conversion. Confirmed to correctly handle optional .
-   ****: Backend API for portability comments. Corrected JWT secret to , migrated database client from  to , and updated all database query result access from  to direct array access.
-   ****: Backend API for portability file uploads. Corrected JWT secret to  and migrated database client from  to .
-   ****: SQL script for portability-related tables. Confirmed that  column is nullable.

<current_work>
The immediate work has been focused on refining the Portabilités section based on recent user feedback.
The AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Fixed the Demandeur selection issue in **:
    *   Corrected the user type check from  to  to ensure the Demandeur select field appears for agents.
    *   Implemented logic to pre-select the demandeur automatically when the logged-in user is a demandeur.
2.  **Implemented a step-by-step navigation system for the portability creation form**:
    *   The form sections (Choix du client, Données du client, Informations de portabilité) in  were transformed into distinct, navigable steps with Suivant and Précédent buttons, enhancing UX.
3.  **Addressed the  visibility and optionality**:
    *   The field is now hidden in the creation form () and is handled as optional () by the backend API (). The SQL schema confirmed this column is nullable.
4.  **Resolved  and  for  and  APIs**:
    *   Identified and corrected inconsistent JWT secrets, aligning them with .
    *   Updated database connection from  to  and adjusted query result access by removing  in  and .
5.  **Converted the portability details view to a modal**:
    *   Created  to encapsulate the detail display.
    *   Modified  to trigger the modal instead of navigating to a new page when Voir détails is clicked.
6.  **Fixed the empty data display in the **:
    *   The  was updated to correctly handle API responses that return data as an array () instead of a direct object, by accessing .

Currently, the user has confirmed that the modal now opens and data is received by the frontend, but the modal content itself still appears empty. This implies the data is being received but not correctly mapped or rendered within the . The AI engineer has identified that the API for a single portability ID () is still returning an array of objects, not a single object, and is investigating  to address this.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Modify the  API to ensure that when a single portability ID is queried, it returns a single object instead of an array containing one object, to simplify frontend data handling.
