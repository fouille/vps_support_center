The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the support ticket application into a comprehensive platform, focusing heavily on a new Portabilités section. This involved adding client management, auto-generated ticket numbers, Mailjet integration, and mirroring ticket functionalities with dedicated SQL tables, Netlify functions (CRUD, comments, file uploads), and React components. The engineer systematically addressed numerous technical challenges, including  issues, navigation conflicts, JWT authentication inconsistencies, and data display problems in modals. Key UX improvements like step-by-step forms and modern comment styles were also implemented. Most recently, the work focused on resolving API data format inconsistencies, JWT payload issues, and a major structural correction regarding file attachments, transitioning from storing them directly in the main  table to using a dedicated  table, updating both backend APIs and frontend components accordingly. A significant addition was an automatic semantic versioning system, integrated with a visible footer.

The core application is a support ticket management system with CRUD for clients, requestors, and agents, a ticket supervision page, and an edit page with file uploads and text exchanges. It uses email/password authentication. Recent enhancements include agent ticket creation, advanced filtering, a messenger-style comment system, automatic status updates, inline agent status changes, automatic comments on file uploads, loader animations, auto-generated 6-digit ticket numbers, refined client management UX (pagination, debounced search, dark mode), and Mailjet integration for notifications.

A new Portabilités section was explicitly requested to manage telecom portability requests, mirroring existing ticket functionalities. This includes supervision, creation, modification, and deletion (for agents), viewing and commenting (for requestors), and auto-generated 8-digit IDs. Required fields for creation are extensive, covering client, dates, numbers, address, and PDF upload. The supervision table needs to display key portability details and support filtering. Visual alerts for effective portability date and email notifications are also required. Further refinements included correcting Demandeur selection logic, implementing step-by-step form navigation, hiding/making optional the Date effective field in creation, resolving  errors for comment APIs due to JWT issues, converting portability details to a modal, and fixing empty modal data display. Recent requests focused on enhancing comment display (date/time, modern styling), adding an Annulation button for demandeurs, fixing automatic form validation at step 3, improving button positioning in modals, and critically, correcting the file attachment storage mechanism to use a dedicated table instead of embedded fields, requiring SQL and API/frontend adjustments. A semantic versioning system with a visible footer was also requested.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and Netlify Functions backend, connected to a Neon PostgreSQL database.


-   ****: Main page for listing portabilities. Now imports and utilizes  to display details instead of navigating to a separate page.
-   ****: Form for creating/editing portabilities. Updated to manage  selection visibility and auto-prefill. Refactored for step-by-step UI and hides  during creation. **Crucially, it has been modified to remove references to  and  from its state and submission payload, now relying on the dedicated file upload API.**
-   ****: Component to display single portability details. Modified to correctly check  and rendered within . **References to old  and  have been removed.**
-   ****: *New file*. Encapsulates portability details, comments, and file uploads within a modal. Includes logic to parse API response (). **Significantly updated to include a button Annulation visible only to demandeurs to pre-fill a comment, implement the modern chat-style comments from tickets (including full date/time), and integrate a full-featured file attachment management system identical to that of tickets, with information on the left, comments on the right, and attachments below. Buttons in the modal header have been shifted left for better UX.**
-   ****: Main layout. Modified to integrate Portabilités into navigation and adapted for state-based navigation.
-   ****: Root React component. Reverted to state-based navigation. **A new  component has been integrated at the application level to display version information.**
-   ****: Exports  directly.
-   ****: Core ticket UI. **Modified to display full date and time for comments () to ensure consistency with portability comments.**
-   ****: *New file*. Centralized configuration for the application's semantic versioning, including current version and build date.
-   ****: *New file*. Renders the application's version and copyright information dynamically from .
-   ****: CRUD API for portabilities. Fixed authentication,  handling, and optional . **Modified to return a single object (not an array) for single ID queries. Crucially, it no longer handles  and  during creation or modification, relying on  for file uploads.**
-   ****: Backend API for portability comments. Corrected JWT secret, migrated DB client to , and adjusted query result access. **Fixed the issue where  was used instead of  or the correctly passed uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) from the JWT token for permission checks.**
-   ****: Backend API for portability file uploads. Corrected JWT secret, migrated DB client to . **Fixed multiple issues in the GET, POST, and DELETE methods: switched from  to , updated JWT field usage from  to , adjusted result access from  to direct array/object access, corrected DELETE method to retrieve  from  instead of the request body, and added SQL joins to retrieve  and  for display.**
-   ****: SQL script for portability-related tables. Confirmed  column is nullable.
-   ****: *New file*. SQL script generated to correct the database schema by dropping the  and  columns from the  table. (Execution is pending).
-   ****: *New file*. A Node.js script to programmatically increment the application's semantic version (major, minor, or patch) and update .
-   ****: *New file*. A Node.js script used by  to automatically update the  file with new version entries and descriptions.
-   ****: *New file*. A smart Node.js script that automatically determines the type of semver increment (major, minor, patch) based on keywords in a provided description and then calls .
-   ****: *New file*. A markdown file automatically updated by the versioning scripts to keep a history of all changes and corresponding versions.
-   ****: *New file*. Documentation explaining the newly implemented automatic versioning system.
-   ****: *Modified*. Updated to include new  for version management (e.g., , , , , , ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical structural inconsistency regarding file attachments in the Portabilités section. Previously, file metadata (name and content) was erroneously being stored directly within the main  table, while a separate  table was intended for file management. The  API for creating/modifying portabilities was still referencing these old fields, and the frontend components were also implicitly expecting or handling them in an inconsistent manner.

The AI engineer has completed the code modifications to resolve this:
1.  **SQL Structure Correction (Script Generated):** A new SQL script, , has been created. This script is designed to remove the  and  columns from the  table, thus ensuring files are exclusively managed via the  table. This script, however, awaits user execution.
2.  **Backend API () Update:** The  Netlify function has been modified to eliminate any handling or references to  and  during portability creation (POST) and modification (PUT) operations. This change ensures that file uploads are now solely processed through the dedicated  endpoint.
3.  **Frontend Component Updates:** The related frontend components,  and , have been updated to remove references to the deprecated  and  fields from their internal state and data handling logic. This ensures the frontend accurately reflects the new data model where file attachments are managed separately.

The AI engineer has made all necessary code corrections related to this file inconsistency. The user's last instruction was to continue, implying the expectation that these code changes are now complete and ready for verification by the user.

<optional_next_step>
Inform the user that the code corrections for the file upload inconsistency (SQL script generated, API and frontend adjustments) are complete, and prompt them to execute the SQL script and verify the attachment display.
