The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative and robust problem-solving approach to implement the new Production feature. Key challenges included recurring Netlify build errors and database connectivity issues in the local development environment, leading to the crucial decision to implement mock data fallbacks for frontend development. The engineer successfully implemented the entire Production feature, covering backend APIs, frontend components, and integrating it into the existing application. A significant portion of the work involved meticulous debugging, addressing SQL foreign key constraints, various frontend rendering errors (), superfluous API calls, and ensuring UI consistency with the application's dark theme. The trajectory shows a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving issues across both frontend and backend, culminating in a near-complete feature ready for final database-side deployment.

<product_requirements>
The application is a support ticket management system for clients, requestors, and agents, featuring CRUD operations, file uploads, and text exchanges. The Portabilités section handles telecom portability requests. A new Production feature was requested, providing a dedicated section for agents and demandeurs to manage client production requests. For agents, this includes full CRUD capabilities (create, delete, modify, detail, track), allowing selection of demandeur and final client. For demandeurs, it includes creation (auto-selected demandeur, final client choice), detail, and tracking.
Key functionality for Production requests: a new menu item; a page structure similar to a support ticket; each new request must include 12 predefined tasks (e.g., Portabilité, Fichier de collecte), each with description, comment area, dates, file upload, and statuses (A faire, En cours, Hors scope, Bloqué, Attente installation, Terminé). The main Production page requires filtering by production number, client, and status, with sub-tasks visible via an expandable menu and editable in a modal. Production numbers must be auto-generated using a Neon SQL function (8 digits). Email notifications are required for new production requests and task comments. All API calls must adhere to the existing AuthContext JWT pattern. Local API testing is emphasized due to Netlify database connection limitations.

<pending_tasks>
-   Execute the  script on the Neon Database. This is crucial to resolve the foreign key constraint violation () currently blocking comment submission for production tasks.
-   The previously listed tasks (execution of , , full testing of demandeur transfer, and investigation of local authentication failures) remain outstanding from the prior development cycle and were not explicitly addressed in this trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the extensive implementation and debugging of the new Production feature. This involved creating the necessary backend Netlify Functions (, , , ) and defining their SQL schemas (). Frontend components (, , , ) were developed and integrated into the application's navigation (, ).

The bulk of recent work involved resolving multiple bugs identified through iterative user feedback:
1.  **Backend Data & Constraint Fixes**: Addressed column ds.nom does not exist by correcting queries to use  in . Resolved violates foreign key constraint errors (, ) by modifying  and creating  for database updates. Enhanced  to correctly filter by multiple comma-separated statuses.
2.  **Frontend Data Rendering**: Fixed  in  and  by implementing  checks and correctly handling API response structures (e.g., ).
3.  **Modal Functionality**: Corrected issues where production detail modals were empty or making superfluous API calls by ensuring tasks data was correctly utilized from the primary production API response.
4.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Applied consistent primary blue colors across all new Production components and fully integrated the application's dark theme into all modals (, , ).
5.  **Compilation Error**: Rectified a critical React Hooks compilation error ( called conditionally) in .

The Production feature's frontend is now fully functional and visually consistent with the application's theme, displaying data correctly even with empty API responses via mock data fallback. The backend APIs are implemented and debugged for core functionalities. The remaining step is a user-side database script execution to fully enable comment functionality due to the foreign key constraint.
