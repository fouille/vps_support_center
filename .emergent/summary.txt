The AI engineer successfully initiated a support ticket management application, pivoting from a mistaken FastAPI backend to Netlify Functions as per user correction. Key challenges involved correctly configuring  and managing JWT authentication across React components and Netlify Functions. The engineer also addressed UI layout issues, implemented a local development server for Netlify Functions, and fixed a persistent Axios base URL problem. Significant feature additions include agent ticket creation, client/requestor loading for all user types, a ticket refresh button, and comprehensive filtering (status, client) for ticket supervision. The current focus is on resolving a 500 error for the new ticket comments API (), which required both database schema updates and correcting the API endpoint's parameter handling on the frontend and backend.

The user requested a support ticket management interface featuring a pastel blue, dark-themed UI (React Admin style). Core functionalities include CRUD operations for  (company name, address, name, first name),  (name, first name, company, phone, email, password – create tickets for clients), and  (name, first name, email, password, company – manage tickets). The application requires a ticket supervision page (title, status, dates) and an edit page (title, linked client, status, creation/modification/due/closure dates, file upload, initial request, text exchanges). Clients should display linked tickets, and requestors should view tickets from their company. The tech stack specified React JS, Netlify deployment, and Neon (PostgreSQL) as the database, explicitly using  and Netlify Functions for the backend. An email/password authentication system is required, differentiating agents (admin@voipservices.fr, admin1234!) and requestors. Recent additions include agents creating tickets (requiring client and requestor selection), a ticket refresh button, ticket status/client filtering for agents, and a comment system within tickets.

- **React JS**: Frontend framework for UI development.
- **Netlify Functions**: Serverless JavaScript functions serving as the backend.
- **Neon Database (@netlify/neon)**: PostgreSQL database service integrated via Netlify's  package.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for securing API endpoints, with tokens stored in .
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and theming (pastel blue, dark mode).
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend, with interceptors for auth token handling.

- ****: Main React component, responsible for routing and overall application structure. Connects  and .
- ****: Manages user authentication state, including login/logout, token storage in , and providing an Axios instance () configured with JWT for authenticated requests. Critical for handling authentication flow and ensuring API calls carry the necessary tokens via Axios interceptors.
- ****: Defines the main application layout, including navigation (sidebar) and content area. Was heavily refactored to fix visual display issues (menu crushing, content misplacement) caused by conflicting Tailwind CSS classes.
- ** (e.g., , )**: These files implement the UI for managing different entities. Initially, some used raw  calls, leading to missing JWT tokens; they were updated to use the  instance from  to ensure proper authentication.  is particularly complex, handling ticket display, creation, editing, and now includes refresh, filtering, and comment sections.
- ****: These are Netlify Functions written in CommonJS (/) that serve as the backend API endpoints. They interact directly with the Neon database using . They were initially incorrectly implemented with ES modules and explicit  parameters, leading to 500 errors. They were corrected to use  without parameters and a consistent CommonJS structure, with a focus on proper error handling and JWT verification.  is the most recently created function for handling comments.
- ****: Contains the SQL DDL for creating all necessary tables in the Neon database (clients, demandeurs, agents, tickets, ticket_echanges). This file is crucial for setting up the database schema.
- ****: A Node.js script created to locally simulate Netlify Functions, allowing frontend development and API testing without deploying to Netlify for every change. It proxies requests to the actual Netlify Functions files.
- ** (frontend and root)**: Manages project dependencies. The  version was a recurring issue that needed correction ().

- Fully implement the ticket comment/exchange functionality. This includes ensuring the API and database interaction for comments are robust, and the frontend display and submission work seamlessly.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving a 500 error encountered with the new  API endpoint, which is designed to handle comments within tickets. This error was identified because the SQL structure for managing comments in the Neon database was missing.
The AI engineer has already:
1.  Created  with the necessary SQL schema for a  table.
2.  Updated the main  to include this new table definition.
3.  Attempted to fix the API routing by considering renaming the Netlify Function file (), but then correctly identified this as an invalid approach for Netlify Functions.
4.  Reverted to a standard approach, modifying the  Netlify Function to accept ticket IDs as *query parameters* rather than path parameters.
5.  Updated  on the frontend to send ticket IDs as query parameters when calling the  endpoint for fetching and posting comments.

The current state of work is the finalization of these corrections for the  API, ensuring the frontend correctly communicates with the backend for comment functionality.

<optional_next_step>
Finalize corrections for the  API by ensuring database structure and frontend/backend parameter handling are fully aligned, then test the comment system end-to-end.
