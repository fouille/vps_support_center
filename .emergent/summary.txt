<analysis>
The AI engineer, initially tasked with expanding the Production feature, systematically addressed a broad range of development and bug-fixing challenges. The trajectory demonstrates a strong focus on enhancing user experience, ensuring data consistency, and correcting critical API/database errors. Key decisions included refining UI elements (e.g., modals, dashboards, client pages), optimizing frontend performance by offloading calculations to the backend, and meticulously debugging persistent database trigger issues. The engineer successfully integrated new features like client-society relationships and strict date validations, demonstrating adaptability in handling complex interdependencies and user-reported bugs. The iterative approach, combined with explicit versioning, ensures a traceable and stable development cycle.

<product_requirements>
The application is a support ticket management system for clients, requestors, and agents, including CRUD, file uploads, and text exchanges. The Portabilités section handles telecom portability. The new Production feature provides a dedicated section for agents (full CRUD, client/demandeur selection) and demandeurs (create, track, client choice) to manage production requests. Requirements include: a new menu item, a page similar to support tickets, 12 predefined tasks with statuses/comments/files, auto-generated 8-digit production numbers, and email notifications. All API calls must use JWT AuthContext. Key updates involved visual date indicators for Portabilités, removal of test account info from login, consistent styling for production modals, agent-only production status editing, dashboard production statistics, server-side advancement calculation for productions, and a revamped Clients page with client-to-societe relation, improved filtering/pagination, full-width display, and menu visibility for demandeurs.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of bug fixes and UX improvements for the application, leading to **Version 1.20.0**. The primary focus was on solidifying the Clients page functionality and ensuring UI/UX consistency across the application.

**Key areas of recent work:**

1.  **Clients Page Modernization and Bug Fixes:**
    *   **Societe Relationship:** Implemented the crucial linkage of clients to . The backend () now handles filtering and assignment based on user role (global access with filter for agents, auto-scoping for demandeurs). The frontend () was updated with new states, data fetching logic for societies, a new Société column in the table, a society filter for agents, and integrated  into the client creation/editing form.
    *   **Persistent API Error Resolution:** The recurring  error during client modifications was exhaustively diagnosed. It was determined to stem from a faulty PostgreSQL trigger referencing a non-existent field. While SQL scripts (, ) were provided for a database-side fix, the final chosen solution was to explicitly set  within the  API's PUT request, ensuring stability without requiring user database manipulation.
    *   **Pagination Fix:** The  was debugged to fix a pagination issue where the page would revert to the first page after a momentary display of the correct one. This involved optimizing  dependencies to prevent infinite loops and ensure stable page navigation.
    *   **Full-Page Layout:** The  layout was refactored to expand to full width, aligning its visual style with the  for a more consistent and modern user interface, including a redesigned header and a refresh button.
    *   **Menu Visibility:** The Mes Clients menu item was added to the  user navigation in , ensuring proper access to the newly enhanced client management features for this user role.

2.  **Production Feature Enhancements:**
    *   **Server-Side Progress Calculation:** The  backend API was updated to calculate  (progress percentage, excluding hors scope tasks) directly via SQL queries. This allows the  to display the progress bar immediately without needing to expand individual production details, improving performance and user experience.
    *   **Hors Scope Date Automation:** In , a new feature was added where if a task's status is set to hors scope and its delivery date is empty, the  automatically defaults to the current day.
    *   **Portability Date Constraint:**  was updated with a client-side validation to ensure the requested portability date () is at least 11 working days (excluding weekends) from the current date.

3.  **Styling Consistency:** Blue gradients were removed from  and  to align with the application's global styling.

4.  **Versioning:** The application has progressed significantly, currently at **Version 1.20.0**, with all changes thoroughly documented via the automated versioning script () in  and other relevant files. The Mes Clients menu visibility was classified as a MINOR version bump (1.19.8 -> 1.20.0).
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The last explicit task of making the Mes clients menu visible for demandeurs was completed. I am awaiting further instructions from the user.
